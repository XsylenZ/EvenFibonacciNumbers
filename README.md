## The challenge
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms.
By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, …

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million,
find the sum of the even-valued terms*.

## Approach
Because every third Fibonacci number is even, there is no need to test for even values.

Example:

1, 1, __2__, 3, 5, __8__, 13, 21, __34__, ...

This is the reason only the third number is added to the sum


## Install

The program can be built via the installation script, within any Linux/MacOS environment with a “bash” shell and CMake version 3.7 or higher. The code is written in C++11:

```
$ ./install.sh
```

When the build has finished successfully it will prompt:

```
To run the executable: ./build/EvenFibonacciNumbers
```

If the installation script does not work, you can also choose to compile the code manually with the following steps:

```
$ mkdir build
$ cd ./build
$ cmake ..
$ make EvenFibonacciNumbers
```

After that run the program:

```
$ ./build/EvenFibonacciNumbers
```
